# # Image Retrieaval using CNN

Image-to-image retrieval is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to find images similar to a provided query image from a large database. This project focuses on developing a neural network-based system for image-to-image retrieval in the context of human action recognition. The system utilizes a deep learning model to extract meaningful features from images and then employs a ranking algorithm to effectively retrieve images depicting similar human actions.
